This is part of portfolio and skills presenting web applications with operational data service tier. Various designs and implementations of generated as single code based hybrid applications with multi tenancy. Connection to application server Web API is realized via remote multi service facades/proxies/ambasadors to create for example: service mesh, nested service providers in SOA or clustered orchestration of microservices. Automatically ganarated generic view components based on Microsoft Fluent UI Library https://www.fluentui-blazor.net. simplifies development of UI to compund view data models based on entities transported from service tier through application tier using contracts (DTO's) to apllication client. Client binds contracts to view data model classes with wide spectrum of annotations and possibility to JIT. Building new view model types compiled at runtime by implemented instant or proxy generators developed using reflection emit. Lightwieght descriptors of type members with essential informations to generate instant type are named member rubrics at domain layer and view rubrics at application layer. Rubrics provide type member information that could be quickly serialized and stored or in other side deserialized and generated or loaded like for example SaaS. This conceptual project can be used to develop application engine with UI designing studio and high scalable backend in the future. All implemented and developed concepts with experimental or well known modern design patterns have one goal. Create compact app engine which can be able to create custom multi tenant ecosystems for various industries. Delivering modern end to end enterprise medium scale cloud solutions with advanced futures represented by for example shared service centers. Primary target is to achive delivery time below 80 man hours of new custom, fully specialized solution for predefined specification draft of product owner needs. Also meeting requirement that uniqueness of generated and implemented code will be above 70% in minimum value product like ERP, CMS, RPA etc. system ;)
